# BankTransactionProcessor

This Java software imitates banking transaction processes, such as opening an account, closing an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and printing the account
details, using inheritance and polymorphism.

It scans information from standard input, such as customer information, the type of account to be created, and a certain amount of money, and processes the transaction 
if no errors are present.

Depending on the type of account (Checking, College Checking, Savings, Money Market), different fees and monthly interests will affect the accountâ€™s balance.
